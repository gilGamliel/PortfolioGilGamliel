        "I’m a full-stack and mobile software developer with hands-on experience building production-grade web and mobile applications from end to end. I work across backend systems, frontend dashboards, and iOS & Android apps, with a strong focus on clean architecture, reliability, and real-world usability.",
        "I’m a Computer Science graduate from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and I worked as a Full-Stack Engineer at Intera, where I developed and maintained scalable systems used by real customers in production environments.",
        "My skill set includes React, Next.js, React Native, Node.js, TypeScript, Firebase, PostgreSQL, and REST APIs, along with experience integrating third-party services and building secure authentication and authorization flows. I also work extensively with AI-powered systems, including prompt engineering and agent-based architectures, and use tools like GitHub Copilot and Codex as part of my daily development workflow.",
        "I enjoy taking ownership of complex systems — from idea and architecture to deployment and iteration — and building software that is not only functional, but stable, maintainable, and ready for real users."
